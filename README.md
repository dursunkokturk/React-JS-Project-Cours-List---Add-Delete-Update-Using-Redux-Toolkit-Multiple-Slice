# Purpose of the Project
Sending the data received from the user to the database using slice and store and printing it to the screen when requested.

Usage React framework,
Listing of courses added using the multiple slice structure in the redux toolkit package.
Using the configureStore structure in the reduxjs toolkit package to array the added courses,
Using the useSelector construct from the react-redux package to print courses in store to the screen,
Adding the information entered on the form to the array structure in the store using dispatch.
Searching in array structure in store using dispatch and useSelector.

# Projenin Amacı
Slice ve store kullanılarak kullanıcıdan alınan data'ları database'e gönderme ve istenildiğinde ekrana yazdırma.

# Slice ve Store Kullanımı
Store klasörü içindeki slices klasörü içinde bulunan couseSlice.js ve formSlice.js dosyaları aracılığı ile kullanıcının girdiği form üzerinden alınan dataları, slice.js dosyasın üzerinden database'e gönderiyoruz.

# Database'den Data Alma
useSelector kullanılarak database'den data'ları alma.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
